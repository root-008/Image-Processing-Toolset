# Image Processing Application - 3 Different Approaches

This repository contains example code demonstrating three different approaches to image processing techniques:

1. **Algorithm Approach**: This approach implements basic image processing algorithms in Python, providing a user-interactive graphical interface. Users can upload images, apply various filters, and view the results through the interface.
2. **MATLAB Approach**: This approach includes code examples that apply various image processing techniques using the MATLAB library, showcasing MATLAB's powerful image processing capabilities.
3. **OpenCV Approach**: This approach uses the OpenCV library to apply image processing techniques with Python code, demonstrating the extensive image processing capabilities and performance of OpenCV.

## Contents

- **main.py**: Python code for creating the graphical interface for the Algorithm approach.
- **models.py**: Python code containing basic image processing algorithms for the Algorithm approach.
- **operations.py**: Python code providing interface functionality for the Algorithm approach.
- **perspective_screen.py**: Python code for creating the perspective correction screen for the Algorithm approach.
- **imageSearch_screen.py**: Python code for creating the image search screen for the Algorithm approach.
- **goruntuIsleme.m**: MATLAB code implementing image processing techniques for the MATLAB approach.
- **filtreler.py**: Python code implementing image processing techniques for the OpenCV approach.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use each approach:

### Algorithm Approach
1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Click the "Load Image" button on the graphical interface to upload an image.
3. Select the desired filter from the "Filters" dropdown.
4. Enter the necessary parameters.
5. Click the "Apply" button to apply the selected filter.
6. View the result image in the "OUTPUT IMAGE" area.
7. Navigate to the perspective correction screen by clicking the "Perspective Correction Screen" button.
8. Navigate to the image search screen by clicking the "Image Search Screen" button.

### MATLAB Approach
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the `goruntuIsleme.m` file.
3. Execute the code for the desired image processing techniques.
4. View the result image in the MATLAB window.

### OpenCV Approach
1. Set up your Python environment and install the OpenCV library.
2. Run the `filtreler.py` file.
3. Execute the code for the desired image processing techniques.
4. View the result image in the OpenCV window.

## Examples

Each approach contains code examples to demonstrate different image processing techniques.

## Notes

- **Algorithm Approach**: This approach is ideal for understanding and implementing basic image processing algorithms. The graphical interface makes it easy for users to experiment with different filters and see their effects.
- **MATLAB Approach**: MATLAB provides a powerful image processing library, making it ideal for learning image processing techniques in MATLAB.
- **OpenCV Approach**: OpenCV offers a high-performance library for image processing, suitable for real-time applications.
